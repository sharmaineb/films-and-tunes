## Films & Tunes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

For the ACS 1320 Final Project, I wanted to create something where photographers and those interested in photography can go to and get inspiration in regards to which film to use. There’s also a description for each film listed.  

A feature included with the film is music. I wanted to pair the film with an album. I also included a song from the album I feel matches the feel and tone of the film. 

Another feature is the places page. These are some of the places where I’ve personally enjoyed taking photos.
